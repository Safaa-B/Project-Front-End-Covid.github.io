			<span>Protect yourself and others from COVID-19</span>
	If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
You also find out more about WHO's recommendations for getting vaccinated on our public advice page on COVID-19 vaccines.

			<p>o	Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing.
      o	The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.
   o	For more information on how to hold events like family gatherings, children’s football games and family occasions, read our Q&A on small public gatherings.
   •	Avoid crowded or indoor settings but if you can’t, then take precautions:
  o 	WHO has published Q&As on ventilation and air conditioning for both the general public and  people who manage public spaces and buildings.
  o	 Wear a mask (see above for more details).
